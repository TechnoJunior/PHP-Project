				Who has to file GST Returns?<br>
				<p>In the GST regime, any regular business has to file three monthly returns and one annual return.
				This amounts to 37 returns in a year.<br><br>

				The beauty of the system is that one has to manually enter details of one monthly return – GSTR-1.
				The other two returns – GSTR 2 & 3 will get auto-populated by deriving information from GSTR-1 filed by you and your vendors..<br><br>
				There are separate returns required to be filed by special cases such as composition dealers .
